- 👋 Hi, I’m @RotatingBuffalo
- 👀 I’m interested in video game development, the nord color palette, and pointless side projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, a bit of java, and quantum computing with Python3 and QISKit. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything honestly, I need experience working with other people.
- 📫 How to reach me --> hit me on discord at Your Attorney#0001
