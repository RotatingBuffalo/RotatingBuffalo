# Hey man, what's good?
- I'm RotatingBuffalo (he/him), a computer science student with experience in Java, C#, C++, and Rust.
- You'll probably find me working on projects related to either video game modding, or linux desktop ricing.
- I'm currently interested in learning functional programming techniques. (all my homies hate global state)
